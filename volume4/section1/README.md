# SECTION  ONE – ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS

In this chapter we will cover Neural networks. With the help of practical example, we will learn to effectively train the neural network. We will cover cv::ml::ANN_MLP class here.

* Understanding neural networks learning algorithms
* Pros and cons of neural network
* Practical tips to effectively train neural network to avoid over-fitting and under-fitting
