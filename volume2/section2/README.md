# SECTION TWO – Support Vector Machines (SVM)

In this chapter, we will learn about Support Vector Machines. We see how SVM is better than Neural networks with practical example. How to extent SVMs to solve multi-class problems. We will cover cv::ml::SVM class here.

* Effective Use of SVMs
* How to solve multi-class classification problems using SVMs
* To Fine tune free parameter and choose right kernel for given problem
* Create pedestrian detection Application
