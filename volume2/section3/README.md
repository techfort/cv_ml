# SECTION THREE – DECISION TREE, BOOSTING, RANDOM TREES AND ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIERS

In this chapter, we will learn about Decision Trees, Boosting and Random Trees algorithms for classification. How to combine these to build efficient classifier.  We will learn cv::ml::Dtree, cv::ml::Boost and cv::ml::Rtrees class here.

We will also talk about how to evaluate the performance different machine learning algorithms learn so far. What are the performance parameters? Same problem can be solved with multiple machine learning algorithms but which one is best suitable for given problem; how to choose best model?

* Understand Decision Tree
* Explore the Random Forest Algorithm and boosting
* Ensemble classifiers
* Performance comparison
