# Introduction

Hi, welcome to Machine Learning with OpenCV course by Packt Publishing.

My name is Joe Minichino, I am a Computer Vision developer and general Machine Learning enthusiast
with several years experience in the field of Computer Vision, especially in a mobile context, and 
Machine Learning as related to Data Analysis and science.
In particular, I have developed applications focusing on face detection and recognition, age and
gender estimation, object detection and recognition.
I am the co-author of Learning OpenCV 3 Computer Vision with Python, together with Joe Howse.

In this video course we will familiarize with OpenCV and the Machine Learning (ml) module in
particular, and explore most of the techniques available to perform Machine Learning tasks with
the state-of-the-art library that is OpenCV.

We will perform tasks such as Image Classification, whose practical applications vary from handwritten 
digit recognition, to pedestrian detection, to face detection and recognition.

## What is OpenCV

OpenCV is a state-of-the-art Computer Vision library which allows to manipulate and process all kinds
of images and videos.
Typical uses of OpenCV include applying filters and enhancements to images, detect foreground and
background, stitch images together, detect and recognize faces, etc.
OpenCV is also a powerful Machine Learning library, allowing to perform tasks such as image
classification, which has numerous real-world applications, including object detection, handwritten
character recognition, registration plate reading and so on.

In this course we will explore the Machine Learning module of the OpenCV library and learn how to
use it for real-life applications.
